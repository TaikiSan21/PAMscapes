Description: A variety of tools relevant to the analysis
    of marine soundscape data. There are tools for downloading AIS (automatic identification system)
    data from Marine Cadastre <https://hub.marinecadastre.gov>,
    connecting AIS data to GPS coordinates, plotting summaries of various soundscape
    measurements, and downloading relevant environmental variables (wind, swell height) from the
    National Center for Atmospheric Research data server <https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds084.1/>.
    Most tools were developed to work well with output from 'Triton' software, but can be adapted
    to work with any similar measurements.
