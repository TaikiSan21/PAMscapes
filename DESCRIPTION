Description: This package contains a variety of tools relevant to the analysis
    of marine soundscape data. There are tools for downloading AIS data from MarineCadastre.gov,
    connecting AIS data to a set of GPS coordinates, plotting summaries of various soundscape
    measurements, downloading relevant environmental variables (wind, swell height), and more.
    Most tools were developed to work well with output from Triton software, but can be adapted
    to work with any similar measurements.
